 I learned so much about styled-components, for example:
 1. How to pass props
 2. How to create global styling
 3. How to create theme

## What i learned:
1. Things listed above
2. How to create fluid responsive website
3. How to make better responsive website
4. Learned how `ch` works
5. How to make Navbar and Dropdown menu
